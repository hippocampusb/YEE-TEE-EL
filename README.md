# YEE-TEE-EL
Hello this is my first public repo, hope no one sees this, I am currently just starting out trying to learn how to create an ETL pipeline. I have no prior experience in software engineering
or coding. What I hope to achieve out of this is to familiarise myself with using GitHub for version control, structuring my repositories and of course, deploying an ETL pipeline! 

To do:
- Set up database
- Create the ETL pipeline
- Unit test and log using logging and pytest

The dataset used for this project is this Bank Marketing dataset from the following link:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing

The datatypes for each column are as follows:

The database schema I will be using will be the star schema to enable faster reads with less complicated joins.

For anyone that comes across this, advice on how to organise my repo, code, and even documentation is much appreciated.
