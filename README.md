# YEE-TEE-EL
Hello this is my first public repo, hope no one sees this, I am currently just starting out trying to learn how to create an ETL pipeline. I have no prior experience in software engineering
or coding. What I hope to achieve out of this is to familiarise myself with using GitHub for version control, structuring my repositories and of course, deploying an ETL pipeline! 

To do:
- Create file directory
- Find dataset
- Create the ETL pipeline
- Unit test and log using logging and pytest

Side quest:
- Pull data from an API
- Set up airflow

For anyone that comes across this, advice on how to organise my repo, code, and even documentation is much appreciated.
